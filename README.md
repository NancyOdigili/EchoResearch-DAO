# EchoResearch DAO

## Overview

EchoResearch DAO is a decentralized Web3 platform built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It creates ad-optional research hubs where users can access basic research content for free, but pay in RES tokens (the platform's native fungible token) for premium, in-depth analyses. All proceeds from premium accesses are directed to support underrepresented researchers (e.g., those from marginalized communities, developing regions, or underrepresented fields). The platform solves real-world problems like funding inequities in academia, barriers to quality research access, and centralized gatekeeping in knowledge dissemination. By leveraging blockchain, it ensures transparent, direct funding to researchers without intermediaries, fostering inclusivity and innovation.

Key Features:
- **Decentralized Research Hubs**: Researchers upload content via IPFS (off-chain storage), with metadata managed on-chain.
- **Token-Based Payments**: Users pay RES tokens for premium analyses, unlocking access via NFTs.
- **Direct Support for Underrepresented Researchers**: Proceeds are escrowed and distributed via DAO governance, prioritizing verified underrepresented contributors.
- **Ad-Optional**: No mandatory ads; users opt-in for token rewards from potential ad integrations (future scope).
- **Governance**: Token holders vote on fund distributions and platform upgrades.

The project involves 6 core smart contracts written in Clarity, ensuring security, transparency, and efficiency on Stacks.

## Real-World Problems Solved

1. **Funding Gaps for Underrepresented Researchers**: Traditional academia often overlooks researchers from underrepresented groups (e.g., women, minorities, global south). EchoResearch provides direct, merit-based funding via user payments.
2. **Access to Quality Research**: Premium analyses are gated but affordable via tokens, democratizing knowledge while rewarding creators.
3. **Transparency in Funding**: Blockchain ensures all transactions and distributions are auditable, reducing corruption.
4. **Centralization in Research Platforms**: Unlike centralized hubs (e.g., Academia.edu), this is community-governed via DAO.
5. **Sustainability**: Token economy incentivizes contributions, solving creator burnout and platform monetization issues.

## How It Works

1. **Researcher Onboarding**: Researchers register and verify their underrepresented status via the ResearcherRegistry contract.
2. **Content Upload**: Upload basic (free) or premium analyses. Premium ones are linked to an NFT for access control.
3. **User Access**: Browse free content. For premium, pay RES tokens to the PaymentEscrow contract, which mints an AccessNFT and routes funds.
4. **Fund Distribution**: Proceeds accumulate in DAOTreasury. Governance contract allows token holders to vote on distributions to verified researchers.
5. **Governance**: RES token holders propose and vote on changes, ensuring community control.

Off-chain components (not included here):
- Frontend: React app interacting with contracts via Stacks.js.
- Storage: IPFS for content files.
- Oracle: For verifying underrepresented status (e.g., via decentralized identity like DID).

## Smart Contracts

The project uses 6 Clarity smart contracts. Below is an overview, followed by code skeletons. All contracts follow Clarity best practices: immutable, secure, and composable.

### 1. ResToken.clar (Fungible Token)
SIP-10 compliant token for payments and governance.

```clarity
;; ResToken - SIP-10 Fungible Token for EchoResearch

(define-fungible-token res-token u1000000000) ;; Total supply: 1 billion

(define-constant ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED u100)
(define-constant CONTRACT-OWNER tx-sender)

(define-public (transfer (amount uint) (sender principal) (recipient principal) (memo (optional (buff 34))))
  (ft-transfer? res-token amount sender recipient)
)

(define-public (mint (amount uint) (recipient principal))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender CONTRACT-OWNER)
    (ft-mint? res-token amount recipient)
    (err ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-balance (account principal))
  (ft-get-balance res-token account)
)

(define-read-only (get-total-supply)
  (ft-get-supply res-token)
)
```

### 2. ResearcherRegistry.clar (Registry for Researchers)
Registers researchers and verifies underrepresented status (via admin or future oracle).

```clarity
;; ResearcherRegistry - Registers and verifies researchers

(define-map researchers principal { is-underrepresented: bool, verified: bool })
(define-constant ERR-ALREADY-REGISTERED u101)
(define-constant ERR-NOT-VERIFIED u102)
(define-constant ADMIN tx-sender)

(define-public (register (is-underrepresented bool))
  (let ((entry (map-get? researchers tx-sender)))
    (if (is-none entry)
      (ok (map-set researchers tx-sender { is-underrepresented: is-underrepresented, verified: false }))
      (err ERR-ALREADY-REGISTERED)
    )
  )
)

(define-public (verify (researcher principal))
  (if (is-eq tx-sender ADMIN)
    (match (map-get? researchers researcher)
      entry (ok (map-set researchers researcher (merge entry { verified: true })))
      (err ERR-NOT-VERIFIED)
    )
    (err ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)
  )
)

(define-read-only (is-verified-underrepresented (researcher principal))
  (match (map-get? researchers researcher)
    entry (and (get verified entry) (get is-underrepresented entry))
    false
  )
)
```

### 3. AnalysisNFT.clar (NFT for Premium Analyses)
SIP-09 compliant NFT representing premium analyses. Metadata includes IPFS hash.

```clarity
;; AnalysisNFT - NFT for premium research analyses

(define-non-fungible-token analysis-nft uint)
(define-map nft-metadata uint { ipfs-hash: (string-ascii 256), researcher: principal, premium: bool })
(define-constant ERR-NOT-OWNER u103)
(define-data-var next-id uint u1)

(define-public (mint (ipfs-hash (string-ascii 256)) (premium bool))
  (let ((id (var-get next-id)))
    (try! (nft-mint? analysis-nft id tx-sender))
    (map-set nft-metadata id { ipfs-hash: ipfs-hash, researcher: tx-sender, premium: premium })
    (var-set next-id (+ id u1))
    (ok id)
  )
)

(define-public (transfer (id uint) (recipient principal))
  (if (is-eq (unwrap! (nft-get-owner? analysis-nft id) (err ERR-NOT-OWNER)) tx-sender)
    (nft-transfer? analysis-nft id tx-sender recipient)
    (err ERR-NOT-OWNER)
  )
)

(define-read-only (get-metadata (id uint))
  (map-get? nft-metadata id)

```

### 4. PaymentEscrow.clar (Handles Payments for Access)
